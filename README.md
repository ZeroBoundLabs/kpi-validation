# CSR

This is our repo for the MVP that we want to build based on the CSR idea and then refined and executed Hackathon idea.
This is the easiest way to get us going, we can use all the infrastructure we have as a start up.
Once we have our funding cleared, then we can have our own dream startup but let's rock it now.

I see this as a one time in life opportunity and if you all want also what I ever dreamed of, then lets do that.
I have always envisioned a start up that fulfills me with joy, where work is more fun than any other feeling and that your taks and contributions makes you feel good because you are doing good. That in an environment of likeminds that don't care about strict rules or traditional orga sets but more into something that is build on execution and trust among each others. 
I also saw a high profitable startup that is super successful and the more success it had, the more impact it made.

I want to live and work from wherever I want, I want to be part of something that that is that big that I am not capable of pulling this off by myself. Also I wanted to use tech and leave a digital social impact. I always believed in collaboration and that many people can get anything done if they belief and trust. Everything I say or state or do is not about power, money, this is abot making a dream become reality. I have been searching long for such an opportunity (2003 to be honest) and I agreed with Frank on that once we have the option to sell license.rocks, we start doing it right away. This is our short cut, our better lifetime hack, lets grab it. I have been building for that the network that we can tap in right away. 

I just a little concerned about fast excution (as we really need that!) and our investors and our current startup, so we need to talk this still out.

But don't worry and please trust me, I will do anything possible to make our dream company to become reality. Please understand that some things are super important and super exciting for me as well, but currently not that important. Also I rather see some parts evolve and other parts being executed asap as website, coding, marketing, fundraising and sales.

Let's get together on Tuesday and start building our all dream.
